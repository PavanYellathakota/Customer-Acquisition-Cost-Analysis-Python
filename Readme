# Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis
### Evaluating Marketing Channel Performance and Efficiency

- This project conducts an in-depth analysis of customer acquisition cost data to evaluate the performance and efficiency of various marketing channels in 2023. Built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment, it leverages libraries like `pandas` and `plotly` for data processing and interactive visualizations.

---
  
## Overview

- This project analyzes the CAC dataset to evaluate marketing performance across channels in 2023.
- We calculate metrics like CAC, Customers per Spend, Conversion Rate, and Break-even Customers,
- and visualize them to understand marketing efficiency and optimize strategies.

---
  
## Dataset Details

- Total Records: 500
**Note**: Since the dataset is clean; no cleaning steps were performed in the provided code.

---
  
## Tools Used

- We used Python with these libraries:
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
**Plotly**: For creating box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts

## Analysis and Results

1. Box Plot: CAC by Marketing Channel
![CAC by Marketing Channel](assets/Results/CAC.png)
- Shows CAC distribution across channels (e.g., Email Marketing, Online Ads).
- **Insight:** Social Media and Email Marketing show relatively lower median CAC, while Referral has the highest median CAC. All channels exhibit high CAC outliers.

2. Scatter Plot: CAC vs New Customers by Channel
![CAC vs New Customers by Channel](assets/Results/CAC2.png)
- Examines CAC vs number of new customers, with trendlines.
- **Insight:** Generally, there's a downward trend, suggesting CAC tends to decrease as the number of new customers acquired increases across all channels. Social Media shows the most significant cost-effectiveness at scale.

3. Scatter Plot: CAC vs Marketing Spend by Channel
![CAC vs Marketing Spend by Channel](assets/Results/CAC3.png)
- Analyzes CAC vs marketing spend, with trendlines.
- **Insight:** A weak upward trend suggests diminishing returns on marketing spend. Online Ads show the most sensitivity to increased spending with a noticeable rise in CAC.

4. Box Plot: Conversion Rate by Marketing Channel
![Conversion Rate by Marketing Channel](assets/Results/CAC4.png)
- Shows distribution of "Conversion Rate" (New_Customers / Marketing_Spend * 100).
- **Insight:** Email Marketing and Referral show higher median conversion rates compared to Online Ads and Social Media. All channels have the potential for high conversion rates, as indicated by outliers.

5. Bar Chart: New Customers per Marketing Spend by Channel
![New Customers per Marketing Spend by Channel](assets/Results/NC_PM.png)
- Compares efficiency (New Customers per INR Spent) across channels.
- **Insight:** Email Marketing is the most efficient in acquiring new customers per INR spent, followed by Online Ads. Social Media is the least efficient based on this metric.

6. Box Plot: Break-even Customers by Channel
![Break-even Customers by Channel](assets/Results/BE_C.png)
- Shows Break-even Customers (equals New_Customers).
- **Insight:** Email Marketing and Referral require a lower median number of new customers to break even, suggesting a faster ROI. Social Media requires the highest.

7. Scatter Plot: CAC vs Conversion Rate by Channel
![CAC vs Conversion Rate by Channel](assets/Results/CAC_C.png)
- Explores trade-off between CAC and "Conversion Rate."
- **Insight:** [Add insight, e.g., do channels with lower CAC have higher efficiency?]

8. Grouped Bar Chart: CAC and New Customers by Channel
![CAC and New Customers by Channel](assets/Results/CAC_NC.png)
- Compares CAC and New Customers side by side (CAC: orange, New Customers: green).
- **Insight:** Referral acquires the highest number of new customers with a moderate CAC. Email Marketing has the highest CAC but still contributes a moderate volume. Social Media has a moderate CAC but the lowest customer acquisition volume.

---
  
## Assumptions and Limitations

- Conversion_Rate (New_Customers / Marketing_Spend * 100) is not a standard metric; lacks impressions/clicks.
- BE_customers equals New_Customers, making it redundant.
- Assumes one value per Marketing_Channel; box plots may show points, not distributions.
- Lacks data on time, region, or campaign details for deeper analysis.

---
  
## Key Takeaways for Marketing Strategy

- Focus on scaling Referral programs due to high customer acquisition volume and moderate CAC.
- Optimize Email Marketing to reduce its high CAC while leveraging its efficiency in customer acquisition per spend.
- Re-evaluate Social Media strategy to improve customer acquisition volume, given its moderate CAC but low output.
- Consider the "New Customers per INR Spent" metric to guide budget allocation towards the most efficient channels like Email Marketing and Online Ads.

---
  
## Future Steps

- To find a dataset with impressions, clicks, or time-based data for proper conversion rates.
- Analyze regional or campaign-specific performance in a future CAC Analysis Version-2.
